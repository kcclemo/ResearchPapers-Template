    <p>There is no one way to accomplish a task, more specifically in texturing. The below is a guideline of the most
      common and effective routes currently and is by no-means the only way to texture for PBR. Final name of this
      document is in consideration. ENJOY!</p>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>An emporium/bible of sorts to wherein I will try to encompass all there is to
      know about creating physically based materials for the next-gen. I am still new to PBR texturing and
      am learning as I make this bible. The reason for me making this is to have a central database for
      artists and developers to look at to help them with their workflow. It&rsquo;s also a great way for
      people who are new to PBR to learn more. Please note that this is just a general guide/bible and is
      not the end-all-be-all. That is to say, there is typically not only 1 way of doing things. Before I
      finish, this document is also for people who have prior knowledge in texturing and making 3D art in
      general.I would like to take this opportunity to thank all the wonderfully talented and innovative people
      who I sourced from for their work on this subject matter. :) PS: This is more for the artistic side
      and less of the math/deep calculations and how it works exactly, etc.</p>

      parts will be from my personal experience/knowledge while other parts will be excerpts taken from sources

      <p>I won't be going through or compiling scientific formulas on how light is perceived and bounces off X material,
        etc. There are many other sites for that online. Instead I'll just be compiling some basic rules of how light
        interactions with types of materials. This will offer a better understanding when texturing in order to achieve more
        realistic results!</p>

        <h2>Diffuse and Specular Reflectance (<a class="c7" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://docs.cryengine.com/display/SDKDOC4/Physically%2BBased%2BRendering&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1571869491814000">source</a>)</h2>
        <p>When light hits a surface, it splits into two directions: some part of it is
          reflected immediately while the rest gets refracted and enters the surface. The refracted light can be
          absorbed or can be scattered around underneath the surface and exit again at a slightly different
          location.</p>

  <p><span class="c15">Light that gets reflected directly from the surface is handled as </span><span
      class="c14">specular </span><span class="c15">reflectance in a shading model. The light that is refracted
      and undergoes subsurface scattering is handled as </span><span class="c14">diffuse </span><span
      class="c1">reflectance.</span></p>
  <p><span class="c1"></span></p>
  <p><span class="c15">The amount of light that is reflected versus refracted depends on the surface
      substance and the angle at which the light hits the surface. At a grazing angle, the amount of light that
      gets reflected directly (specular) gets higher, until it reaches 100% at an extreme angle. This behavior is
      described by the </span><span class="c14">Fresnel </span><span class="c15">effect.</span></p>

  <p><span class="c15">There are only two categories of substances which are relevant for rendering:
    </span><span class="c14">metals </span><span class="c15">(conductors like iron, gold, copper, etc.)
      and</span><span class="c14"> non-metals</span><span class="c1"> (dielectric materials like
      plastic, stone, wood, skin, glass, etc.). Both have special characteristics regarding diffuse and specular
      reflectance.</span></p>
  <p><span class="c1"></span></p>
  <p><span class="c15">Metal has </span><span class="c14">no diffuse reflection</span><span class="c15">.
      This means that </span><span class="c14">metal </span><span class="c15">should have a</span><span class="c14">
      black diffuse</span><span class="c15"> color. All visible light is reflected directly
      from the surface (specular reflectance). The different types of </span><span class="c14">metal </span><span
      class="c15">have </span><span class="c14">characteristic specular colors</span><span class="c1">.</span></p>
  <p><span class="c1"></span></p>
  <p><span class="c15">Metal actually neither refracts nor absorbs ANY light, metals are so dense that
      light can&#39;t actually enter the surface, which is why all of the light is reflected. </span><span
      class="c9">(</span><span class="c34 c9"><a class="c7"
        href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.polycount.com/forum/showpost.php?p%3D2088046%26postcount%3D8&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1571869491817000">source</a></span><span
      class="c26 c9">)</span></p>
  <p><span class="c1"></span></p>
  <p><span class="c1">In contrast to metal, non-metal has diffuse reflection, however the specular
      reflection is a lot weaker and less varied than for metal. Specular reflectance for non-metal is
      monochromatic (no color, just gray). Most non-metals reflect only a small fraction of the light as specular,
      for most materials between 2% and 5%.</span></p>

      class="c9">)</span></p>
  <p><span class="c15">R</span><span class="c1">eflection and diffusion are mutually exclusive. This is
      because, in order for light to be diffused, light must first penetrate the surface (that is, fail to
      reflect). This is known in shading parlance as an example of &ldquo;energy conservation&rdquo;, which just
      means that the light leaving a surface is never any brighter than that which fell upon it originally.</span>
  </p>
  <p><span class="c1">This is easy to enforce in a shading system: one simply subtracts reflected light
      before allowing the diffuse shading to occur. This means highly reflective objects will show little to no
      diffuse light, simply because little to no light penetrates the surface, having been mostly reflected. The
      converse is also true: if an object has bright diffusion, it cannot be especially reflective.</span></p>

        title=""></span></p>
  <p><span class="c1">Energy conservation of this sort is an important aspect of physically-based shading.
      It allows the artist to work with reflectivity and albedo values for a material without accidentally
      violating the laws of physics (which tends to look bad). While enforcing these constraints in code
      isn&rsquo;t strictly necessary to producing good looking art, it does serve a useful role as a kind of
      &ldquo;nanny physicist&rdquo; that will prevent artwork from bending the rules too far or becoming
      inconsistent under different lighting conditions.</span></p>
  <p><span class="c1"></span></p>
  <p><span class="c1">When the equations are properly balanced, a renderer should display rough surfaces as
      having larger reflection highlights which appear dimmer than the smaller, sharper highlights of a smooth
      surface. It is this apparent difference in brightness that is key: both materials are reflecting the same
      amount of light, but the rougher surface is spreading it out in different directions, whereas the smoother
      surface is reflecting a more concentrated &ldquo;beam&rdquo;:</span></p>
  <p class="c28"><span
      style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 571.50px; height: 168.93px;"><img

        title=""></span></p>
  <p><span class="c1">Here we have a second form of energy conservation that must be maintained, in
      addition to the diffusion/reflection balance described earlier. Getting this right is one of the more
      important points required for any renderer aspiring to be &ldquo;physically-based&rdquo;.</span></p>

  <p><span class="c15">Though not entirely important to know for the sake of texturing, the single most
      important thing to know about gamma according to the article is: An image taken from a camera stored on your
      hard drive is brighter/pastelish compared to what is displayed on your monitor. How this breaks down
      is that the camera takes a photo. The light is captured and the camera applies a formula/split each pixel
      into 255 levels. </span><span class="c14"> Stored in gamma space</span><span class="c1">. The image is
      now &ldquo;brighter&rdquo; than it is in real life. Once the image is on your hard drive and viewed
      through your monitor, another series of events take place where the gamma affects the image by a standard of
      2.2 and gets output to the monitor looking the way it should (like in real life).</span></p>

      the texture is read by the hardware, it is in </span><span class="c14">gamma-space</span><span class="c15"> (1st
      image). But the pow(x,2.2) converts the texture
      back into</span><span class="c14"> linear-space</span><span class="c15"> (2nd image). Then we do
      the lighting calculations (3rd image). Now that we have the final image that we want, we apply a
      pow(x,1/2.2) to convert it back into </span><span class="c14">gamma-space</span><span class="c15">. The
    </span><span class="c14">gamma-space</span><span class="c1"> image is sent to the monitor, which applies
      it&rsquo;s own pow(x,2.2) and displays the final image.</span></p>
  <p><span class="c15">Of course, those pow() functions aren&rsquo;t free in a shader. But they are in fact
      free if you use the hardware sampler states. For the texture read, you can use D3DSAMP_SRGBTEXTURE, and for
      the write to the framebuffer, you can use D3DRS_SRGBWRITEENABLE. So now your shader has the same code as
      before, and the hardware states give you the conversions for free.</span></p>

      falloff of the real image, but the gamma one does not.</span></p>
  <p><span class="c1">So that&rsquo;s how to make your image look &ldquo;correct&rdquo;. Making it look

  <p><span class="c15">Physically based rendering (PBR) refers to the concept of using realistic
      shading/lighting models along with measured surface values to accurately represent real-world materials.
    </span><span class="c14">PBR </span><span class="c15">is more of a </span><span class="c14">concept </span><span

  <p><span class="c40 c15">The biggest difference of a physically based model compared to other older game
      models is the use of specular. While a specular mask was often used to vary the intensity of specular
      highlights over a surface, the</span><span class="c14 c40"> specular color</span><span class="c40 c15"> is a
    </span><span class="c14 c40">physical value</span><span class="c40 c15"> now
      which is </span><span class="c14 c40">constant </span><span class="c40 c15">for a </span><span
      class="c14 c40">single type </span><span class="c40 c15">of </span><span class="c14 c40">material</span><span
      class="c40 c15">. To get </span><span class="c14 c40">variation
    </span><span class="c40 c15">in the highlights, a </span><span class="c14 c40">gloss/reflection map</span><span
      class="c40 c15"> should be used instead. Gloss is more powerful than the traditional specular mask, as
      gloss influences not only the brightness of a highlight but also it&#39;s size and the sharpness of
      environmental reflections.</span></p>
  <p><span class="c26 c9"></span></p>
  <p><span class="c1">Note that every engine/shader varies in one way or another to how it represents the
      physical world, specifically lighting. Values/textures in UE4 may differ from CryENGINE 3 and
      Marmoset, etc. </span></p>

  <p><span class="c1">The most trivial explanation of a PBR/PBS/BRDF (physical based renderer / physical
      based shader / bidirectional reflectance distribution function) is that it is the bit of shader code
      describing how a surface reacts to light. Generally, it is responsible for calculating the specular
      highlights and diffuse characteristics of the surface material. They are mathematical approximations of how
      surfaces react to light in the real world. In computer graphics, we try to model the physical world as
      accurately as possible, but we are constrained by computation. For this reason, the mathematical efficiency
      of BRDFs is very important. Some of the better known BRDFs - Blinn, Phong and Lambert, for instance - are
      well known for this reason: they are computationally inexpensive to calculate and intuitive to adjust.
      However they compromise efficiency for accuracy. If we concern ourselves with more expensive and more
      accurate models, we uncover a second layer of shading models: Oren-Nayar, Cook-Torrance, Askikhmin-Shirley,
      etc.</span></p>
  <p><span class="c1"></span></p>
  <p><span class="c1">There is no single model that fits every situation, but there are some better than
      others. The Cook-Torrance model has been shown to be a top performer, when compared against actual acquired
      BRDF data. Of course, with the good comes the bad and Cook-Torrance is one of the most expensive models to
      compute. But for overall results, it is hard to beat. So this is our target; a nice implementation of the
      Cook-Torrance reflectance model. Now this maybe an issue when using Cook-Torrance model on mobiles and
      consoles due to hardware limitations, so it&#39;s a question of which module to use. </span></p>

  <p><span class="c15">There are different types of substances in real world. They can be classified in
    </span><span class="c14">three main group</span><span class="c1">: Insulators, semi-conductors and
      conductors.</span></p>
  <p><span class="c15">In game we are only interesting by two of them: </span><span class="c14">Insulators
    </span><span class="c15">(Dielectric materials) and </span><span class="c14">conductors </span><span
      class="c1">(Metallic materials).</span></p>
  <p><span class="c1">Artists should understand to which category a material belong to. This will have
      influence on diffuse and specular value to assign to this material.</span></p>
  <p><span class="c1"></span></p>
  <p><span class="c1">Dielectric materials are the most common materials. Their optical properties rarely
      vary much over the visible spectrum: water, glass, skin, wood, hair, leather, plastic, stone, concrete,
      ruby, diamond&hellip;</span></p>
  <p><span class="c15">Metals. Their optical properties vary over the visible spectrum: iron, aluminium,
      copper, gold, cobalt, nickel, silver&hellip;</span></p>

  <p><span class="c29 c23 c38">Diffusion &amp; Reflection</span></p>
  <p><span class="c14">Diffusion </span><span class="c15">and </span><span class="c14">reflection
    </span><span class="c15">&ndash; also known as &ldquo;</span><span class="c14">diffuse</span><span
      class="c15">&rdquo; and &ldquo;</span><span class="c14">specular</span><span class="c1">&rdquo; light
      respectively &ndash; are two terms describing the most basic separation of surface/light interactions. Most
      people will be familiar with these ideas on a practical level, but may not know how they are physically
      distinct.</span></p>
  <p><span class="c1"></span></p>
  <p><span class="c12">Reflection/Specular</span></p>
  <p><span class="c1">When light hits a surface boundary some of it will reflect &ndash; that is, bounce
      off &ndash; from the surface and leave heading in a direction on the opposing side of the surface normal.
      This behavior is very similar to a ball thrown against the ground or a wall &ndash; it will bounce off at
      the opposite angle. On a smooth surface this will result in a mirror-like appearance. The word
      &ldquo;specular&rdquo;, often used to describe the effect, is derived from the latin for
      &ldquo;mirror&rdquo; (it seems &ldquo;specularity&rdquo; sounds less awkward than &ldquo;mirrorness&rdquo;).

      can be used as references. Moreover, we can see that specular colors for metallic objects are close to what
      we think the color of the metal is. The basic rule for metal is to set up a value above 0.5.</span></p>

  <p><span class="c12">Diffuse/Albedo</span></p>
  <p><span class="c1">Not all light reflects from a surface, however. Usually some will penetrate into the
      interior of the illuminated object. There it will either be absorbed by the material (usually converting to
      heat) or scattered internally. Some of this scattered light may make its way back out of the surface, then
      becoming visible once more to eyeballs and cameras. This is known by many names: &ldquo;Diffuse
      Light&rdquo;, &ldquo;Diffusion&rdquo;, &ldquo;Subsurface Scattering&rdquo; &ndash; all describe the same
      effect.</span></p>
  <p><span class="c1"></span></p>
  <p><span class="c15">The absorption and scattering of diffuse light are often quite different for
      different wavelengths of light, which is what gives objects their color (e.g. if an object absorbs most
      light but scatters blue, it will appear blue). The scattering is often so uniformly chaotic that it can be
      said to appear the same from all directions &ndash; quite different from the case of a mirror! A shader
      using this approximation really just needs one input: &ldquo;</span><span class="c14">albedo</span><span
      class="c15">&rdquo;, </span><span class="c14">a color which describes the fractions of various colors of
      light that will scatter back out of a surface</span><span class="c15">. &ldquo;Diffuse color&rdquo; is a
      phrase sometimes used synonymously.</span></p>

  <p><span class="c15">In the past, it was usual to bake everything in a &ldquo;diffuse&rdquo; texture to
      fake lighting effects like shadow, reflection, specular&hellip; With newer engines, all these effects are
      simulated and </span><span class="c14">must not be baked</span><span class="c1">. The best definition for
      diffuse color in our engine is : How bright a surface is when lit by a 100% bright white light.</span></p>
  <p><span class="c26 c9"></span></p>
  <p><span class="c26 c9">The lighting unit for these light sources is specified as the color a white
      lambertian surface would have when illuminated by the light from a direction parallel to the surface
      normal.</span></p>
  <p><span class="c26 c9"></span></p>
  <p><span class="c1">This mean that when you set up a light in the game editor with 1 in brightness and
      point it directly on a quad mapped with a diffuse texture, you get the color as displayed in Photoshop (be
      aware of postprocess).</span></p>

  <p><span class="c1">One of the darkest substances on earth is charcoal, the brightest is fresh
      snow.</span></p>
  <p><span class="c1"></span></p>
  <p><span class="c29 c24">Translucency &amp; Transparency</span></p>
  <p><span class="c1">In some cases diffusion is more complicated &ndash; in materials that have wider
      scattering distances for example, like skin or wax. In these cases a simple color will usually not do, and
      the shading system must take into account the shape and thickness of the object being lit. If they are thin
      enough, such objects often see light scattering out the back side and can then be called translucent. If the
      diffusion is even lower yet (in for example, glass) then almost no scattering is evident at all and entire
      images can pass through an object from one side to another intact. These behaviors are different enough from
      the typical &ldquo;close to the surface&rdquo; diffusion that unique shaders are usually needed to simulate
      them.</span></p>
  <p><span class="c46 c40 c15 c51 c67"></span></p>
  <p><span class="c23 c38 c63">Metals</span></p>
  <p><span class="c15">Firstly, metals tend to be much more reflective than insulators (non-conductors).
    </span><span class="c14">Conductors </span><span class="c15">will usually exhibit </span><span
      class="c14">reflectivities </span><span class="c15">as </span><span class="c14">high </span><span class="c15">as
    </span><span class="c14">60-90%</span><span class="c15">, whereas </span><span class="c14">insulators </span><span
      class="c15">are generally much </span><span class="c14">lower</span><span class="c15">, in the</span><span
      class="c14"> 0-20%</span><span class="c1">
      range. These high reflectivities prevent most light from reaching the interior and
      scattering, giving metals a very &ldquo;shiny&rdquo; look.</span></p>
  <p><span class="c1"></span></p>
  <p><span class="c15">Secondly, reflectivity on conductors will sometimes vary across the visible
      spectrum, which means that their reflections appear tinted. This </span><span class="c14">coloring
    </span><span class="c15">of </span><span class="c14">reflection </span><span class="c15">is rare even among
      conductors, but it does occur in some everyday materials</span><span class="c14"> (e.g. gold, copper,
      and brass)</span><span class="c15">. Insulators as a general rule do not exhibit this effect, and their
      reflections are uncolored.</span></p>
  <p><span class="c1"></span></p>
  <p><span class="c1">Finally, electrical conductors will usually absorb rather than scatter any light that
      penetrates the surface. This means that in theory conductors will not show any evidence of diffuse light. In
      practice however there are often oxides or other residues on the surface of a metal that will scatter some
      small amounts of light.</span></p>
  <p><span class="c1"></span></p>
  <p><span class="c15">It is this duality between metals and just about everything else that leads some
      rendering systems to adopt &ldquo;metalness&rdquo; as a direct input. In such systems artists specify the
      degree to which a material behaves as a metal, rather than specifying only the albedo &amp; reflectivity
      explicitly. This is sometimes preferred as a simpler means of creating materials, but is not necessarily a
      characteristic of physically-based rendering.</span></p>

  <p><span class="c15">To put it simply, fresnel is the percentage of light that a surface reflects at
      grazing angles. </span></p>
  <p><span class="c1"></span></p>
  <p><span class="c15">In computer graphics the word Fresnel </span><span class="c14">refers to differing
      reflectivity that occurs at different angles</span><span class="c15">. Specifically, light that lands on a
      surface at a grazing angle will be much more likely to reflect than that which hits a surface dead-on. This
      means that </span><span class="c14">objects rendered </span><span class="c15">with a </span><span
      class="c14">proper Fresnel effect</span><span class="c15"> will appear to have </span><span class="c14">brighter
      reflections near the edges</span><span class="c15">. Most of us have been familiar with
      this for a while now, and its presence in computer graphics is not new. However, PBR shaders have made
      popular a few important corrections in the evaluation of Fresnel&rsquo;s equations.</span></p>
  <p><span class="c1"></span></p>
  <p><span class="c1">The first is that for all materials, reflectivity becomes total for grazing angles
      &ndash; the &ldquo;edges&rdquo; viewed on any smooth object should act as perfect (uncolored) mirrors, no
      matter the material. Yes, really &ndash; any substance can act as a perfect mirror if it is smooth and
      viewed at the right angle! This can be counterintuitive, but the physics are clear. (Ex. Probably akin to
      asphalt looking like water/wavy mirror at extreme angles)</span></p>
  <p><span class="c1"></span></p>
  <p><span class="c1">The second observation about Fresnel properties is that the curve or gradient between
      the angles does not vary much from material to material. Metals are the most divergent, but they too can be
      accounted for analytically.</span></p>
  <p><span class="c1"></span></p>
  <p><span class="c1">The shading system can now handle the Fresnel effect almost entirely on its own; it
      has only to consult some of the other pre-existing material properties, such as gloss and
      reflectivity.</span></p>

  <p><span class="c15">A PBR workflow has the artist specify, by one means or another, a &ldquo;base
      reflectivity&rdquo;. This provides the minimum amount and color of light reflected. The Fresnel effect, once
      rendered, will add reflectivity on top of the artist specified value, reaching up to 100% (white) at
      glancing angles. </span><span class="c21 c14">Essentially the content describes the base, and
      Fresnel&rsquo;s equations take over from there, making the surface more reflective at various angles as
      needed.</span></p>
  <p><span class="c15">There is one big caveat for the Fresnel effect &ndash; it quickly becomes less
      evident as surfaces become less smooth. More information on this interaction will be given a bit later
      on.</span></p>
  <p><span class="c1"></span></p>
  <p><span class="c15">Fresnel generally should be set to 1 (and is locked to a value of 1 with the
      metalness reflectivity module) as all types of materials become 100% reflective at grazing angles. Variances
      in microsurface which result in a brighter or dimmer Fresnel effect are automatically accounted for via the
      gloss map content.</span><span

  <p><span class="c23 c38 c63">Microsurface (Roughness/Gloss)</span></p>
  <p><span class="c1">Most real-world surfaces have very small imperfections: tiny grooves, cracks, and
      lumps too little for the eye to see, and much too small to represent in a normal map of any sane resolution.
      Despite being invisible to the naked eye, these microscopic features nonetheless affect the diffusion and
      reflection of light.</span></p>
  <p><span class="c1"></span></p>
  <p><span class="c1">Microsurface detail has the most noticeable effect on reflection (subsurface
      diffusion is not greatly affected and won&rsquo;t be discussed further here). In the diagram to the left,
      you can see parallel lines of incoming light begin to diverge when reflected from a rougher surface, as each
      ray hits a part of the surface with a different orientation. In short, the rougher the surface gets, the
      more the reflected light will diverge or appear &ldquo;blurry&rdquo;.</span></p>
  <p><span class="c1"></span></p>
  <p><span class="c15">Unfortunately, evaluating each microsurface feature for shading would be prohibitive
      in terms of art production, memory use, and computation. So what are we to do? It turns out if we give up on
      describing microsurface detail directly and instead specify a </span><span class="c14">general measure of
      roughness</span><span class="c15">, we can write fairly accurate shaders that produce similar results. This
      measure is often referred to as &ldquo;</span><span class="c14">Gloss</span><span class="c15">&rdquo;,
      &ldquo;</span><span class="c14">Smoothness</span><span class="c15">&rdquo;, or &ldquo;</span><span
      class="c14">Roughness</span><span class="c15">&rdquo;. It can be specified as a</span><span class="c21 c14">
      texture or as a constant for a given material.</span></p>

  <p><span class="c15">This </span><span class="c14">microsurface </span><span class="c15">detail is
      a</span><span class="c14"> very important</span><span class="c1"> characteristic for any material,
      as the real world is full of a wide variety of microsurface features. Gloss mapping is not a new concept,
      but it does play a pivotal role in physically-based shading since microsurface detail has such a big effect
      on light reflection. As we will soon see, there are several considerations relating to microsurface
      properties that a PBR shading system improves upon.</span></p>
  <p><span class="c1"></span></p>
  <p><span class="c14">Microsurface gloss directly affects the apparent brightness of
      reflections</span><span class="c15">. </span><span class="c14">This means an artist can paint variations
      directly into the gloss map &ndash; scratches, dents, abraded or polished areas, whatever &ndash; and a PBR
      system will display not just the change in reflection shape, but relative intensity as well.</span><span
      class="c1"> No &ldquo;spec mask&rdquo;/reflectivity changes required!</span></p>
  <p><span class="c1"></span></p>
  <p><span class="c1">This is significant because two real world quantities that are physically related
      &ndash; microsurface detail and reflectivity &ndash; are now properly tied together in the art content and
      rendering process for the first time. This is much like the diffusion/reflection balancing act described
      earlier: we could be authoring both values independently, but since they are related, the task is only made
      more difficult by attempting to treat them separately.</span></p>
  <p><span class="c1"></span></p>
  <p><span class="c15">Further, an investigation of real world materials will show that reflectivity values
      do not vary widely (see the earlier section on conductivity). A good example would be water and mud: both
      have very similar reflectivity, but since mud is quite rough and the surface of a puddle is very smooth,
      they appear very different in terms of their reflections. An artist creating such a scene in a PBR system
      would author the difference primarily through gloss or roughness maps rather than adjusting reflectivity, as
      shown above.</span></p>
  <p><span class="c1"></span></p>
  <p><span class="c15">Microsurface properties have other subtle effects on reflection as well. For
      example, the &ldquo;edges-are-brighter&rdquo; </span><span class="c14">Fresnel effect diminishes</span><span
      class="c15"> somewhat with </span><span class="c14">rougher surfaces </span><span class="c15">(the
      chaotic nature of a rough surface &lsquo;scatters&rsquo; the Fresnel effect, preventing the viewer from
      being able to clearly resolve it). Further, large or concave microsurface features can &ldquo;trap&rdquo;
      light &ndash; causing it to reflect against the surface multiple times, increasing absorption and reducing
      brightness. Different rendering systems handle these details in different ways and to different extents, but
      the broad </span><span class="c14">trend </span><span class="c15">of </span><span class="c14">rougher
      surfaces appearing dimmer is the same</span><span class="c1">.</span></p>
  <p><span class="c1"></span></p>
  <p><span class="c15">This section only serves as a very basic and introductory lesson to the world of
      PBR. I won&rsquo;t be going in-depth on the math and science behind it as more links will be provided
      in the </span><span class="c14">additional references</span><span class="c1"> section. However

  <p><span class="c1">This section will cover the basics of creating art in the PBR workflow. It will
      do its best to answer questions before you even have them. It won&rsquo;t get too technical however as
      that will be covered in another section if the need arises.</span></p>
  <p><span class="c1"></span></p>
  <p><span class="c1">Artists who are unfamiliar with the concept of PBR systems often assume that content
      creation is drastically different, usually because of the terminology that is used. If you&rsquo;ve worked
      with modern shaders and art creation techniques you already have experience with many of the concepts of a
      physically based rendering system.</span></p>
  <p><span class="c1"></span></p>
  <p><span class="c1">Figuring out what type of content to create, or how to plug your content into a PBR
      shader can be confusing, so here are some common terms and concepts.</span></p>

  <p><span class="c23 c37 c38">Advances in Technology</span></p>
  <p><span class="c15">Since the conception of this encyclopedia back in 2014 there has been so many
      advances in technology and the production side of art, so much so that a lot of the how-to guide is outdated
      but I will still leave it in (partially to show what texturing was like pre-Painter and also just for those
      information junkies). From the Quixel suite making huge strides to Allegorithmic releasing newer and
      better tools for the pipeline (Substance Painter &amp; Designer), it&rsquo;s been easier than ever to have
      materials that resemble their real-world counterparts. But tread lightly as heading this also makes
      one&rsquo;s base knowledge of how to get to life-like materials weak. You&rsquo;re essentially pushing
      and pulling sliders, which is totally fine! It speeds up workflow and produces faster and better results,
      but sometimes it&rsquo;s nice to know where things started/came from. In spite of this, the Substance
      library makes it very easy to produce fantastic results with minimal effort (compared to before when one had
      to author each map individually, </span><span class="c14">manually</span><span class="c15">) but also leaves
      room for some faking of materials (maybe throwing up the metalness slider up to achieve a certain look).
      Just be wary and informed.</span><span class="c1"> </span></p>

      when the light source is directly above the surface. This is the minimum specular intensity, under grazing
      angles it will increase due to the Fresnel effect. As the specular color is specific for a certain type of
      material, it can also be considered as a mask for the type of material/substance. The specular color is a
      physical value which should be picked directly from a reference table. As such, it does not leave much

  <p><span class="c1">Traditional specular maps offer more control over the the specular intensity and
      color, and allow greater flexibility when trying to reproduce certain complex materials. The main drawback
      to a specular map is that it generally will be saved as a 24 bit file resulting in more memory use. It also
      requires artists to have a very good understanding of physical material properties to get the values right,
      which can be a positive or negative depending on your perspective.</span></p>
  <p><span class="c1"></span></p>
  <p><span class="c1">Most non-metals reflect 2% to 5% of the light as specular and the highlight is
      monochrome/gray. As the variation is so little, it is often enough to use a constant specular color instead
      of a specular texture map. However, if metal and non-metal are mixed in a single texture, it is required to
      use a specular map, as metal has a much brighter specular color than non-metal. If a specular map is used,
      the specular color in the material editor should be set to white which is 255/255/255, as it gets multiplied
      with the values from the specular map and would otherwise lower the physical values from the map.</span></p>

  <p><span class="c1">So the way the metalness thing works is basically this:</span></p>
  <p><span class="c14">A.</span><span class="c1"> Your albedo map is both your diffuse and spec
      map</span></p>
  <p><span class="c14">B. </span><span class="c1">The metanless map defines which sections are metal and
      which are not. But what its really doing is the more metal it is, the more it darkens the diffuse and pulls
      the specular intensity and color from the albedo. Black values in the metalness map represent non-metals,
      and for those, a low, fixed specular intensity is used (I don&#39;t remember the value off hand).</span></p>
  <p><span class="c1"></span></p>
  <p><span class="c1">However, If you use mid-values in the metalness mask you can sort of hack it into
      doing what you want. You don&#39;t need to stick to black or white. But then it will pull the spec color
      from there as well, which works for things like Christmas ornaments, but not really for glossy
      plastics.</span></p>
  <p><span class="c1"></span></p>
  <p><span class="c1">But really, if you want fine control over the specular color and specular intensity
      for non-metals, you shouldn&#39;t be using the metalness function, you should use the standard blinn-phong,
      as that will let you do exactly that. With energy conservation on, and a bright spec intensity value with
      blinn-phong, it will basically work the same as the metalness thing (ie: it will darken the diffuse to make
      it appear more metal-ish)</span></p>

  <p><span class="c1">A cavity map represents small scale occluded light and is generally baked from a 3d
      model or a normal map. An easy and painless way of creating a cavity map would be by using NDO2 wherein it
      generates it via a normal map.</span></p>
  <p><span class="c1"></span></p>
  <p><span class="c15">A cavity map should only contain the concave areas (pits) of the surface, and not
      the convex areas, as the </span><span class="c14">cavity map is multiplied</span><span class="c15">. The
      content should be mostly white with darker sections to represent the recessed areas of the surface where
      light would get trapped. The </span><span class="c21 c14">cavity map affects both diffuse and specular from
      ambient and dynamic light sources.</span></p>
  <p><span class="c1"></span></p>
  <p><span class="c14">Alternatively</span><span class="c1">, a reflection occlusion map can be loaded into
      the cavity slot, but be sure to set the diffuse cavity value to 0 when doing this.</span></p>

  <p><span class="c40 c15">When you are using gamma space lighting, the colors and textures that are
      supplied to a shader have a gamma correction applied to them. When they are used in a shader the colors of
      high luminance are actually brighter than they should be for linear lighting. This means that as light
      intensity increases the surface will get brighter in a non linear way. This leads to lighting that can be
      too bright in many places, and can also give models and scenes a washed-out feel. When you are using linear
      lighting, the response from the surface remains linear as the light intensity increases. This leads to much
      more realistic surface shading and a much nicer color response in the surface.</span></p>

  <p><span class="c1">There are many ways to create texture content for PBR systems; the exact method you
      choose will depend on your personal preferences and what software you have available to you. Here is a quick
      recap of the method I used to create the lens above:</span></p>
  <p><span class="c1"></span></p>
  <p><span class="c1">First, basic materials were created in Toolbag for each surface type using a
      combination of tiling textures from Megascans, measured data from known materials, and where lacking
      appropriate reference, logic and observation, to determine the values. Creating the base materials in
      Toolbag allows me to quickly adjust values and offers a very accurate preview of the end result. </span></p>
  <p><span class="c21 c14"></span></p>
  <p><span class="c14">Tip: </span><span class="c1">Often I assign base materials directly to my high poly
      model to get a clear idea of how the texture will come together before doing the final bakes.</span></p>
  <p><span class="c1"></span></p>
  <p><span class="c1">After setting up my base materials I brought the values and textures into Photoshop
      and started layering them in a logical manner. Brass at the bottom, nickel plating, matte primer, semi-gloss
      textured paint, paint for the lettering, and finally the red glossy plastic. This layering setup provides an
      easy way to reveal the various materials below with simple masks.</span></p>
  <p><span class="c1"></span></p>
  <p><span class="c1">After I have my base layers set up and blended together to represent various stages
      of wear, I added some extra details. First I used dDo to generate a dust and dirt pass, and then I finished
      it off with fine surface variation in the gloss map.</span></p>
  <p><span class="c1"></span></p>
  <p><span class="c1">The exact method you use to create content for a PBR system is much less important
      than the end result, so feel free to experiment and figure out what works best for your needs. However, you
      should void tweaking materials values to look more interesting in a specific lighting environment. Using
      sound base values for your materials can greatly simplify the process, increase consistency and asset reuse
      on larger projects, and will ensure that your assets always look great no matter how you light them.</span>

  <p><span class="c1">So UE4 uses slightly different parameters and handles maps a little differently
      compared to other shaders/engines. In this section I will illustrate those points.</span></p>
  <p><span class="c1">Base colour, roughness, metallic, and specular inputs take 0 to 1 values.</span></p>
  <p><span class="c1"></span></p>
  <p><span class="c24">Porosity</span></p>
  <p><span class="c15">The Dontnod chart include an unusual parameter named </span><span
      class="c14">Porosity</span><span class="c15">. This parameter is the &ldquo;open porosity&rdquo; of a
      material. It can be used for driving weathering and aging effect (Pollution, rain, aging&hellip;). More
      details on its usage can be found in previous blog post: </span><span class="c34 c15"><a class="c7"

        drop 3b &ndash; Physically based wet surfaces</a></span><span class="c1">. In practice Dontnod use it
      mainly with the dynamic wet formula provided in the mentionned previous post.</span></p>
  <p><span class="c1">The range is remapped from 0-1 to 0-70% of open porosity. There is real worl image to
      try to give a feeling of what the value mean. An extremely porous material is the clay (70%), but open
      porosity can vary a lot for same material, clay could also be only 50%.</span></p>

      range of the first gradient 50-243. There is some sample values of real world material in sRGB below the
      gradient. Some of these values are base on real world measured material (from misc sources, not done by us)
      and other are have been generated by Laurent Harduin. He take calibrated raw picture of representative
      material, take the luminance histogram in Photoshop and use the value of the medium axis for the luminance.
      Then he blur the picture and take one pixel inside the blurred region and use that as the color value. This
      explain why in few case like the clean cement the color and the luminance doesn&rsquo;t match perfectly. We
      also lower a bit the value to take into account the invevitable specular present during the capture.</span>

  <p><span class="c1">Commonly, if we modify Specular, we do so to add micro occlusion or small scale
      shadowing, say from cracks represented in the normal map. These are sometimes referred to as cavities. Small
      scale geometry, especially details only present in the high poly and baked into the normal map, will not be
      picked up by the renderer&#39;s real-time shadows. To capture this shadowing, we generate a cavity map,
      which is typically an AO map with very short trace distance. This is multiplied by the final BaseColor
      before output and multiplied with 0.5 (Specular default) as the Specular output. To be clear this is
      BaseColor = Cavity*OldBaseColor, Specular = Cavity*0.5.</span></p>

  <p><span class="c1">Yes, metalness maps should generally be 0 or 1.</span></p>
  <p><span class="c14">Metalness </span><span class="c15">defines whether the surface is a raw metal or not
      (this is important, </span><span class="c14">painted metal isn&#39;t metal</span><span class="c1"> for
      instance, its paint).</span></p>
  <p><span class="c1"></span></p>
  <p><span class="c15">For </span><span class="c14">metallic surfaces, the specular intensity is pulled
      from the albedo </span><span class="c15">map, while the diffuse is darkened to 0 (raw metals reflect nearly
      100% of light, so they don&#39;t really have a diffuse component). This basically means that the
      albedo for </span><span class="c14">raw metals</span><span class="c1"> is black. </span></p>
  <p><span class="c1"></span></p>
  <p><span class="c15">For </span><span class="c14">insulators</span><span class="c15">, or non-metals, the
    </span><span class="c14">diffuse color is pulled from the albedo</span><span class="c1"> map, while the
      specular intensity is set to a fix value (0.04 or so), as most non metals reflect light in very narrow range
      of values.</span></p>
  <p><span class="c1"></span></p>
  <p><span class="c14">Gloss/roughness</span><span class="c1"> maps define how glossy or rough a
      surface is, and how tight or wide the specular reflections are. Glossier surfaces have tighter, more intense
      highlights, while rougher surfaces have wider/blurrier and more dim highlights. This applies regardless of
      material type. If the surface is a glossy plastic, you make it glossy in the gloss map. For wear and
      tear and such, say for where the gloss coating on the plastic is worn off, you would make it more rough in
      the gloss map. You shouldn&#39;t be painting highlights or lighting of any sort into any maps with modern
      shaders.</span></p>
  <p><span class="c1"></span></p>
  <p><span class="c1">Generally engines will use a full color spec map, or a metalness map. The biggest
      difference is really how the content is packed. Its true that the metalness workflow gives you less control,
      but its more efficient memory wise as you can pack more info into less textures. The theory with the
      metalness thing is that it is harder for artists to use incorrect specular values (artists have a tendency
      to eyeball stuff, which often looks ok under one set of lighting but totally wrong in another).</span></p>
  <p><span class="c1"></span></p>
  <p><span class="c1">As far as glossy plastic goes, you should be able to do this just fine with a
      metalness map and your gloss map. Something like a car paint shader is more complex and would likely require
      a custom shader.</span></p>
  <p><span class="c1"></span></p>
  <p><span class="c21 c14">The best way to visualize these concepts is to load up TB2/EU4, add a sphere,
      and play with simple parametric materials. Adjust the gloss/roughness values, observe how the reflections
      change. Play with the metalness value, etc.</span></p>

      texture. In sRGB space, a 50% mid-gray is not 0.5 or 127 but rather 0.5 raised by the inverse of gamma 2.2
      which equals 187 in Photoshop. In a nutshell, the reason that sRGB is used is to avoid banding artifacts. In
      sRGB space you get more precision for darker colors to which the human eye is more sensitive. Before working
      on colors, please make sure that your screen is calibrated properly.</span></p>

  <p><span class="c1">Gather reference for each material type/part of the object. </span></p>
  <p><span class="c15">Start by doing a</span><span class="c14"> rough block</span><span class="c15"> in
      for each </span><span class="c14">material type</span><span class="c1">, this
      doesn&rsquo;t have to be exact but should be close enough so that you have a good base to start tweaking
      from.</span></p>
  <p><span class="c1"></span></p>
  <p><span class="c1">For each material I start with the reflectance value, these can be found in various
      charts online, if I can&rsquo;t find a reflectance value for a certain material, I try to determine it with
      logical reasoning (ie, worn out rubber will be less reflective, brass is a mix of copper and zinc,
      etc).</span></p>
  <p><span class="c1"></span></p>
  <p><span class="c1">Reflectance values are the easiest to start off with, and give you a good base for
      the other maps. For insulators, its important to keep to keep the values within the small range that
      non-metals typically reflect. For metals, its important to make the diffuse black first, and then find the
      appropriate reflectance value. After this I will assign a quick roughness value, usually by just sorting
      materials into 3 categories (shiny, middle or rough). Then I pick an albedo color, paying attention here to
      keep things consistent and not too dark. I also toggle through various skies to make sure the materials are
      consistent in a variety of lighting conditions. Once this initial stage is over I fall back on observation
      for the fine tuning these values, since every material is different, keeping in mind the concepts of PBR. At
      this point I like to add a basic overlay to the normal map for materials that have a strong surface
      variation, such as bumpy plastic.</span></p>
  <p><span class="c1"></span></p>
  <p><span class="c1">Its important to remember that values in the reflectance map only change when there
      is an actual change in material.</span></p>

  <p><span class="c15">Gloss/roughness maps and metalness maps tend to be linear space as well, but they
      don&#39;t necessarily have to be. From a practical perspective, any input that defines a percentage value
      (like gloss and metalness), makes sense to use linear color space for the texture input. This is so you can
      easily mock up a material will a parametric input in your shader (which tends to be linear space), and then
      easily duplicate that value in </span><span class="c14">photoshop </span><span class="c15">by selecting the
      color with the </span><span class="c14">brightness input in the color picker</span><span class="c1">. The
      values for these maps will not be accurately visualized in photoshop though (which works in gamma space by
      default), so its important to verify the results in the actual shader/game/renderer and not worry about what
      it looks like in 2D.</span></p>
  <p><span class="c1"></span></p>
  <p><span class="c15">Generally it&#39;s important for this to be consistent throughout your project,
      which maps are in linear or gamma space. Its</span><span class="c14"> not something that should vary
      per asset</span><span class="c15">, so talk to your technical artist, engineers, etc if you&#39;re confused
      about which to use. Again, you don&#39;t need to set photoshop up in a special way to use linear space
      textures, just </span><span class="c14">remember to check</span><span class="c15"> the final
    </span><span class="c14">result in game</span><span class="c1">. There are some more technical things to
      consider, like if you&#39;re using gamma space specular but find a measured reflectance value in linear
      space. In that case you will need to convert the values.</span></p>
  <p><span class="c1"></span></p>
  <p><span class="c15">Lastly, all your textures do not need to be linear space &quot;to be pbr&quot;,
      I&#39;ve heard this before, I&#39;m not sure what the source of this information is but its factually
      incorrect. Color space simply defines how much precision is used for the darker values (more in the case of
      sRGB) vs a linear distribution of precision for the data (linear space). </span><span class="c14">Color
      space in regards to texture inputs actually has nothing to do with physically based rendering (other than
      the fact that you may need to convert your measured base values - which depends on the source of said
      values)</span><span class="c1">. However, most renderers that have PBR shaders, the renderer itself is in
      linear space(for a variety of technical reasons), but this is something different entirely.</span></p>

  <p><span class="c15">[</span><span class="c14">Metalness workflow</span><span class="c1">] In 99% of
      cases, metals should be black or white but rust is an exception. You really don&#39;t want midtones
      unless you are blending between two materials ( non metal and metal). Especially with something like rust.
      You will end up with something that is giving off orange specular (which rust doesn&#39;t) and is very dark
      in the diffuse. I would keep it close to either end of the spectrum, but not in between. The areas which are
      only lightly rusted, are quite significantly less reflective than the un-rusted areas. But maybe you
      would still want a metalness value of 0.1 or 0.2 or something, as its probably a bit more reflective than
      0.04.</span></p>
  <p><span class="c1"></span></p>
  <p><span class="c1">Minor science bit here:</span></p>
  <p><span class="c1">You may remember from school that chemical reactions are irreversible, and usually
      happen &quot;instantly&quot;. the same is true of oxidation, once a molecule becomes oxidized it stays that
      way forever. That&#39;s why when you want to get a rust patch cleaned off of your car, you have to sand it
      right down to the bare metal and treat it from there.</span></p>
  <p><span class="c1"></span></p>
  <p><span class="c1">Now, how to apply that to your metalness map:</span></p>
  <p><span class="c1">Start off with white, this is your metallic layer, which will always be underneath
      the oxidized layer. then take a black brush, and adjust the opacity of the brush to reflect how THICK you
      want the layer of oxidation to be. the thicker the layer of oxidation, the blacker it becomes. It&#39;s
      possible to have a very fine/thin layer of oxidation that still allows a lot of light to be reflected by the
      underlying metal, but it&#39;s also possible for the oxidation to become so thick that no light can be
      reflected by the metal beneath.</span></p>
  <p><span class="c1"></span></p>
  <p><span class="c1">Of course, as with everything, this isn&rsquo;t the only way to approach this and is
      just one method someone prefers. Don&rsquo;t get caught up with steps and following everything to the
      letter because another approach to the above would to alter the albedo/spec map more than the metalness map,
      etc. Refer to the tutorial/examples </span></p>

  <h1 id="h.3iq8n6ne609e"><span class="c64 c62 c38 c79">FAQ</span></h1>
  <p><span class="c29 c24">I don&rsquo;t know how to use a PBR system, will I need to re-learn how to
      create art content?</span></p>
  <p><span class="c1">In most cases, no. If you have experience with previous generation shaders which use
      dynamic per-pixel lighting you already possess much of the knowledge necessary to create content for a PBR
      system. Terminology tends to be one of the biggest stumbling blocks for artists, so I have written a section
      on various terms and translations below. Most of the concepts here are simple and easy to pick up.</span>
  </p>
  <p><span class="c1"></span></p>
  <p><span class="c1">If your experience lies mostly with hand painted/mobile work, learning the new
      techniques and workflows outlined here may be more of a challenge. However, likely not more difficult than
      picking up a traditional normal map based workflow.</span></p>
  <p><span class="c1"></span></p>
  <p><span class="c24 c29">If I use a PBR shader does that mean my artwork is physically accurate?</span>
  </p>
  <p><span class="c1">Not necessarily; simply using a PBR shader does not make your artwork physically
      accurate. A PBR system is a combination of physically accurate lighting, shading, and properly calibrated
      art content. The deciding factor on whether or not it looks physically accurate is the texture
      work.</span></p>
  <p><span class="c1"></span></p>
  <p><span class="c29 c24">Do I need to use a metalness map for it to be PBR?</span></p>
  <p><span class="c1">No, a metalness map is just one method of determining reflectivity and is generally
      not more or less physically accurate than using a specular color/intensity map.</span></p>
  <p><span class="c1"></span></p>
  <p><span class="c29 c24">Do I need to use index of refraction (IOR) for it to be PBR?</span></p>
  <p><span class="c1">No, similar to the metalness map input, IOR is simply an alternate method to define
      reflectivity.</span></p>
  <p><span class="c1"></span></p>
  <p><span class="c29 c24">Is specular no longer a thing?</span></p>
  <p><span class="c1">Not quite. Specular reflection intensity, or reflectivity is still a very important
      parameter in PBR systems. You may not have a map to directly set reflectivity (e.g. with a metalness
      workflow) but it is still required in a PBR system.</span></p>
  <p><span class="c1"></span></p>
  <p><span class="c29 c24">Do gloss maps replace specular maps?</span></p>
  <p><span class="c15">No, gloss or roughness maps define the </span><span class="c14">microsurface
    </span><span class="c1">of the material (how rough or smooth it is), and do not replace a specular intensity
      map. However, if you&rsquo;re not used to working with gloss maps, it may be somewhat of an adjustment to
      put certain detail in the gloss map that you would otherwise add to the specular map. Generally spec maps
      (in the non-metalness workflow) are quite flat in comparison to its predecessor while gloss/roughness maps
      remain more or less the same; all the microsurface details are located here. Even those that would be
      too small for the normal map. (depending on the engine).</span></p>
  <p><span class="c1"></span></p>
  <p><span class="c29 c24">Can a PBR system be used to create stylized art?</span></p>
  <p><span class="c1">Yes, absolutely. If your goal is to create a fantastical, stylized world, having
      accurate material definition is still very important. Even if you&rsquo;re creating a unicorn that farts
      rainbows, you still generally want that unicorn to obey the physics of light and matter. A great example of
      this is Pixar&rsquo;s work, which is very stylized, yet often on the cutting edge of material accuracy.

  </p>
  <p><span class="c29 c24">What is all this talk about sRGB, gamma, and linear? And why is it
      important?</span></p>
  <p><span class="c1">sRGB, gamma, and linear are colour spaces used when defining a certain colour.
      A simpler way to think about it is RGB vs CMYK. sRGB stands for standard RGB colour space.
      This is basically how light/information is displayed.</span></p>
  <p><span class="c1"></span></p>
  <p><span class="c14">sRGB </span><span class="c15">is for all intensive purposes, synonymous with gamma
      (gamma corrected). It is of an exponential graph. 0 - 255. As an fyi, the neutral gray/mid point of a
      gamma colour space is 187, </span><span class="c14">not</span><span class="c1"> 127/128. </span></p>
  <p><span class="c14">Linear </span><span class="c1">is, as it sounds, a linear graphic. 0 - 1</span></p>
  <p><span class="c21 c14"></span></p>
  <p><span class="c24 c63">Does the old workflow of baking in the AO/cavity into your diffuse and spec
      still apply? </span><span class="c9">(</span><span class="c34 c9"><a class="c7"
        href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.polycount.com/forum/showpost.php?p%3D2088451%26postcount%3D21&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1571869492096000">source</a></span><span
      class="c9">)</span></p>
  <p><span class="c14">[AO] </span><span class="c1">No. In the PBR workflow it does not apply. (Check
      with your respective engine/shader for more details) I leave it to the infamous Earthquake of Marmoset
      to elaborate. </span></p>
  <p><span class="c14">[Cavity] </span><span class="c1">It can still be applied to the albedo and spec
      maps. (Check with your respective engine/shader for more details) Engines like TB2 offer the ability to
      input an occlusion and cavity map with sliders to adjust its influence on diffuse/spec.</span></p>
  <p><span class="c1"></span></p>
  <p><span class="c14">Large scale AO</span><span class="c15"> really should </span><span class="c14">not
    </span><span class="c15">be </span><span class="c14">baked </span><span class="c15">into
    </span><span class="c14">specular </span><span class="c1">(or the metallic materials of an albedo map when using
      the metalness workflow), or diffuse, this just does not make much sense physically. As mentioned above, when
      you do that, your AO is occluding direct light sources, which is very much the incorrect thing to do. Just
      think about it for a second, if you have the inside of a helmet, naturally your baked ao map would get a lot
      darker there right? Now, put a light source directly inside that helmet, what happens in real life?</span>
  </p>
  <p><span class="c1"></span></p>
  <p><span class="c1">If that content is baked into your textures, you can never light that area correctly
      in a game.</span></p>
  <p><span class="c1"></span></p>
  <p><span class="c29 c24">Is one workflow or route better than the other?</span></p>
  <p><span class="c1">Not really, it&rsquo;s just boils down to which you personally get better results
      from, are more comfortable with, which engine you are using, and if you are texturing in an office, which
      method they use.</span></p>
  <p><span class="c1"></span></p>
  <p><span class="c29 c24">Will artists need to capture photographic reference with a polarized camera
      system for every material they wish to create?</span></p>
  <p><span class="c15">No, generally you will be provided with reference for common materials by your
      studio. Alternatively, you can find known values from various 3rd party sources, like </span><span

  <p><span class="c1"></span></p>
  <p><span class="c29 c24">Is there a way to grab albedo/spec, etc values from real life?</span></p>
  <p><span class="c15">There is! But it requires some equipment and knowledge of colour space as well
      as how to use a camera. On top of that it requires knowledge of the Macbeth chart and other various
      &ldquo;tools&rdquo; to get an accurate reading. Polycount&rsquo;s almighty_gir has made a </span><span

        tutorial</a></span><span class="c1"> on this. </span></p>
  <p><span class="c1"></span></p>
  <p><span class="c26 c9">Caution: If you have no clue what you are doing, you could potentially be pulling
      inaccurate values. Consult the tutorial and read through the posts for a better understanding.</span>
  </p>
  <p><span class="c1"></span></p>
  <p><span class="c29 c24">Where is texturing headed? Is it going to be procedural from now
      on?</span></p>
  <p><span class="c15">There&rsquo;s no definitive answer for this. What I do know is that more
      procedural tools are becoming more available. They are a blessing and a little bit of a curse I think.
      Blessing because it speeds up production and accuracy but for those who are not competent on texturing
      and rely on these programs may not see their skill level increase and if their studio does not have said
      tool, well they&rsquo;re on their own. Some procedural-oriented tools off the top of my head include
      Substance Designer and DDO. Still if one has time, it&rsquo;d be of their benefit to learn such
      programs and add them to their arsenal.</span></p>
  <p><span class="c1"></span></p>
  <p><span class="c29 c24">Is there a central database for material values for albedo, spec, roughness,
      etc?</span></p>
  <p><span class="c15">There is and there isn&rsquo;t. There is from those that are publically shared
      and there isn&rsquo;t from the studios whom use their values specific to their engines. Regardless, please
      do take care when using values and don&rsquo;t pigeonhole yourself into thinking that a value is the only
      value for that material.</span></p>
  <p><span class="c1"></span></p>
  <p><span class="c29 c24">Any tips for making my work look good?</span></p>
  <p><span class="c1">Ensure that you have accurate albedo, spec, and roughness values. Once you do
      and a decent texture job has been done, your object will look great in any lighting condition.
      Don&rsquo;t adjust values for a specific lighting environment as it may not look as well in other
      settings, etc.</span></p>
  <p><span class="c1"></span></p>
  <p><span class="c29 c24">How do I make sure I have the &ldquo;exact&rdquo; value needed for a
      material?</span></p>
  <p><span class="c15">There is no </span><span class="c14">exact</span><span class="c15"> value for
      any given material as in the real world, many factors influence the physical values of that item. Long
      story short, just utilize some base values found online as a </span><span class="c14">starting
      point</span><span class="c15"> and adjust it in small increments until it looks like the material
      you&rsquo;re attempting to represent. It becomes easier with more practice and looking up values will
      be needed less.</span></p>
  <p><span class="c1"></span></p>
  <p><span class="c29 c24">Is there a way to get better at PBR/PBT?</span></p>
  <p><span class="c15">Yes. There are multiple ways. Some include: practice - you&rsquo;ll get
      no where and won&rsquo;t get any better without practice. Tutorials and looking at other artists&rsquo; work
      (assuming their work is accurate) will help train your eye into identifying what looks accurate.
      Another way is to learn more about science and physics and the nature of light/materials and their
      interaction with each other and the world around us. You kind of have to step into the realm of a
      technical artist almost...just a smidge. </span></p>
  <p><span class="c1"></span></p>
  <p><span class="c29 c24">I&rsquo;m new to PBR but it looks like this method of texturing is a lot more
      troublesome than before?</span></p>
  <p><span class="c1">Not true in my opinion. It may look this way because this is new to you but
      once you&rsquo;ve gotten used to it or know of the workflow, it&rsquo;s actually simpler in a sense, and
      quicker. You don&rsquo;t have to repeat diffuse details in all other maps, ensure gloss looks
      interesting VS spec and diffuse, etc. As well, more procedural based/material layering software has
      come into the market that aid in next-gen texturing.</span></p>
  <p><span class="c1"></span></p>
  <p><span class="c29 c24">How come there is not more math and theory/concept in this
      &ldquo;encyclopedia&rdquo;?</span></p>
  <p><span class="c15">This doc was originally compiled/made for artists to read and get a grasp on PBR.
      As such I guess I neglected those who were interested to know the underlying details of PBR. For
      now please point your attention to the </span><span class="c34 c15"><a class="c7"
        href="#h.oxe8vtv1hlf7">Additional Readings &amp; References</a></span><span class="c1"> for more
      information.</span></p>
  <p><span class="c1"></span></p>
  <p><span class="c29 c24">How come my textures look different in UE4 VS Marmoset VS Unity, etc?</span></p>
  <p><span class="c1">That is because every engine handles PBR/values/light/materials differently.
      For example I recently textured a vehicle in PBR and my values were fine in Marmoset but when I
      brought it into Unity, they were not correct and as such made it look diluted and not textured at all.
      Lacked material definition. So generally when texturing, always preview in the engine the model
      is meant for.</span></p>
  <p><span class="c1"></span></p>
  <p><span class="c29 c24">Is there any easier way of texturing in PBR?</span></p>
  <p><span class="c15">Short answer is yes, there is. Substance Painter/Designer and the Quixel Suite
      are just 2 of the most common packages one can use to texture. They have preset materials with values
      already and even have different previews depending on which engine you will ultimately export to. Not
      many people texture manually now as it is rather time consuming from a production standpoint and just not as
      flexible/versatile. Though being </span><span class="c14">able</span><span class="c1"> to texture
      manually and knowing how to would help with your knowledge overall.</span></p>
  <p><span class="c1"></span></p>
  <p><span class="c29 c24">Where&rsquo;s the future of texturing headed?</span></p>
  <p><span class="c15">My guess? If/when it becomes feasible/economical/practical, photogrammetry. It
      involves taking high res photos of a subject at specific angles under ideal lighting conditions (I hear
      overcast/neutral is best) and using a program, it is able to extrapolate all that data but from the examples
      I&rsquo;ve seen, the results (there needs to be tweaking and authoring of course) I&rsquo;ve seen, they look
      a little on the duller side in terms of spec/gloss.</span></p>
